## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
* Users interested in quiz games.
* Users interested in general knowledge.
* Users interested in trying to score higher than their friends.
‚Äã
### **User Stories:**
* As a user, I want to have fun.
* As a user, I want to know the rules to the game.
* As a user, I want to be able to choose how difficult the game is going to be.
* As a user, I want to be aware of how many errors I have made.
* As a user, I want to keep track of all the letters I have guessed.
* As a user, if I lose, I want to know the word I did not guess.
* As a user, I want to replay the game as many times as I want.
‚Äã
### **Site Aims:**
* To provide a fun game.
* To create a challenge for the user.
* To provide an excellent user experience without any errors or bugs.
‚Äã
## **Current Features**
‚Äã
#### *Main Screen:*

* Main screen of the game. User can choose to start the game.

#### *Difficulty selection:*

* Once the user enters the game, they are requested to choose the difficulty. The difficulty is based on the length of the word. Depending on what difficulty level the user chooses, the code runs and returns a word from a list.

#### *Rules:*

* After the user chooses the difficulty, the rules are presented. Aiming for the user experience, the user is informed of what expected from the game and how to proceed correctly so that they can have the best experience with the game.

#### *Game:*

* The game starts with three main parts: the hangman design (empty, because there is no mistakes yet), the random word hidden and the request for the user to guess a letter. Once the user guesses the first letter, two more items are added to the game: the used letters lists (so the user can see which letters they already guessed) and the amount of mistakes they made.

#### *Congratulations and Game Over:*

* There is two outcomes of the game: the user can either win or lose. If they win, they are greeted with a congratulations message and an invitation to play again. If the user loses, they receive a Game Over message, the information of what was the word and also the invitation to replay the game.

## **Future-Enhancements**
‚Äã
* Color can be added to the game to provide a better user experience. 
‚Äã
## **Testing Phase**
‚Äã
* Responsiveness - To ensure that the responsiveness of the website was the best possible, to project was built having the mobile access as the base of the design. The initial tests were made on the mobile, extensively and in different models, to confirm that the website was delivering what it was proposed.

    On mobile, the website was tested on the following devices:
    * Samsung 20FE
    * Iphone 13 Pro Max

    No issues were noted upon project completion.

    On tablets, the website was tested on the following device:
    * Ipad Air 4

    No issues were noted upon project completion.

    On notebooks, the website was tested on the following devices:
    * Dell Latitute 15
    * Macbook Air

    No issues were noted upon project completion.

    For the desktop tests, an Asus VX228 monitor was also used.
    No issues were noted upon project completion.
‚Äã
* Functionality - 
    * On entrance of the game, both buttons, when clicked bring the user to the relevant section. Topscores buttons does not shows the congratulations message or the option to add the score.
    * While on game, the user can choose one of the options, the click provides the user with the information if they were correct on their choice (the background color of the option changes to red or green, if wrong or correct, respectively) and also calls the function for another question to be presented.
    * When user answers 10 questions, the final section is presented, with the user score and with the possibility for them to add to the top 5 scores.
    * The user is requested to add their name and email to be able to add the score. The top scores are them updated with the new information, if the score is within the top five.
    * On the last section, a play game is also displayed, if the user desires to play the game again. The games gets rebooted.

## **Deployment**
I deployed the page on Heroku via the following procedure: -
‚Äã
1. Push the code Github [repository](https://github.com/AlexDralur/hangman-game-python).
2. Log in or Sign up to Heroku where you need to create a new app.
3. Select a unique name.
4. In the settings tab reveal the config vars, for this project one had to be added per Code Institutes guidance.
5. For KEY, input PORT and for VALUE, imput 8000 and click add.
6. Below that, click add buildpack, select Python and save.
7. Click add buildpack again, now select Nodejs and save.
8. Python should be above Nodejs on the buildpack list.
9. Go to deploy tab and for deployment method select GitHub and connect your GitHub account.
10. When prompted enter the repository you want to deploy, search and once found connect it.
11. Now you can either set it automatically or manually deploy the appropriate branch.
12. Automatically will deploy the app everytime you push something to GitHub.
13. Manually you have control over when the app should be deployed, but you have to remember to do it.
14. It might take a little while, but once the app is built Heroku will have a link to the live web page.

You can find the game live via the following URL - [live game]()
